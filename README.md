# open_motor
This repo provides an open source motor controller library, with control inputs over ROS Serial, adaptable to many hardware control schemes. In current development, the library is implemented on a teensy4.0 using a Teensy4 Motor Shield. 

This Teensy4 Motor shield incoroporates 2x L298N motor driver ICs, 4 encoder inputs, and 4 current measurement circuits allowing for control of 4 DC motors. The firmware provided here allows for direct integration into robotics projects to get protoypes running quickly.

This repo serves as documentation for the motor controller library as well as documentation for the hardware.

### Features
- ROS Control with custom messages using rosserial on ROS-Melodic
- Dynamic PID tuning for each controller 
- Position and Velocity Setpoints for each motor
- Abstracted Motor Controller Library
- Custom UDEV rules and USB parameters for automatic port connection (Linux)

## Wiring
The Teensy4.0 Motor Controller v1.1 provides 4 motor outputs, 4 encoder inputs, power input, and headers to plug in the Teensy4.0.
Each motor block, 0-3, is outlined on the screen print of the board and contains the motor output screw terminals, the encoder pin inputs, and the 4 flyback diodes that enable motor direction. Motor leads can be connected to the boards using the screw terminals and the corresponding encoder is plugged into the vertical pins behind it. Please use the boards screen print and the diagram shown in the **Board Dimensions** section. 

The next step is to plug in the Teensy4.0 into the female headers, and then the power input, VS and GND to the right of the Teensy Headers, can be wired. It is important to have an independent power switch for the power input as the power to the motor controller must be turned on after the Teensy microcontroller has been powered up, this power switch can even be a relay connected to the host computer allowing programatic switching of motor power. **It is imperative that power be provided to the Teensy4.0 via USB before power is given to VS or the board will burn** this is because the Teensy's 3.3V output is used as a reference for the level shifters that allow 5V encoders to be read by the 3.3V logic Teensy.

## Installation
This board is supplied with a firmware allowing for 4 motor control out of the box. This motor controller library uses ROS for PID parameter and setpoint communication as well as feedback. 

### Setting up the host computer
#### ROS
These instructions assume you already are familiar with ROS and Linux based OS. Furthermore, this system has been developed for ROS1 Melodic, any other distros are not yet tested.

First, ensure that rosserial is installed on you system, if not install using

        sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosserial
        
or to test another distro please use

        sudo apt-get install ros-<your distro>-rosserial

#### Python

All board dimensions are taken from Eagle CAD, feel free to round dimension numbers when convenient. It should be noted that the heat sinks on the L298N IC stick up 30mm from the top of the PCB.
